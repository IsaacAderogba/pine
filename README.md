# Pine, an extensible and headless text-editor framework

[Pine](https://github.com/IsaacAderogba/pine) is a JavaScript framework for building rich-text editors. It's based on the [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) toolkit, and emphasizes composability and customizability.

> Importantly, Pine has been built for my own personal use cases and is thus centered on my needs. If you wish to extend its functionality, you're encouraged to fork the package.

Pineâ€™s libraries include the following:

| Library       | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `@pine/core`  | Framework-agnostic API for building text editors. |
| `@pine/react` | React-bindings for the core library.              |
